This project is a task management system developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. Users can register, log in, add, view, and delete tasks, as well as switch between light and dark themes 🌞🌙. The project uses local text files for data storage, so there is no need for a database.

- User registration and login 🔑
- Adding, viewing, and deleting tasks ✅❌
- Ability to switch themes (light/dark) 🌞🌙

```

### 2. Set up local server execution:

2. **Login**: After registration, users can log in using their username and password.

3. **Adding and Managing Tasks**: Users can add new tasks and mark them as completed or delete them.

4. **Theme Switching**: You can switch the theme from dark to light using a button in the top-right corner.
